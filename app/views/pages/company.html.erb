                   	HomeHubr is simply designed to empower sellers who chose to utilize alternative methods to sell their property.  Our method is simple, we keep some of the property informaiton opaque until the buyer purchases the rights to learn more about the property.  This is our way of ensuring the seller is only contacted by serious investors/buyers.
